</div><div>KNOW ABOUT HIPAA COMPLIANCE AND 
</div><div>CLOUD SERVICES
</div><div>
</div><div>A Guide for Healthcare Providers and 
</div><div>Their Business Associates
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div></h2>
                    <div class="mbr-section-text">
                        <p class="mbr-text mb-5 pt-3 mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">As a health care provider or business associate, you’re at the center of a confluence of forceful trends:
<br>●	With the Affordable Care Act, more and more patients have access to healthcare.
<br>●	HIPAA and other laws and regulations demand rigorous protection of sensitive patient data and protected health information, and impose severe penalties for those business associates that fail to comply with such requirements.
<br>●	As always, you need to maximize cost efficiency—which means, among other things, spending wisely on information technology (IT) that’s integral to modern health care delivery and management. 
<br>
<br>This guide for health care administrators and IT managers summarizes what you need to know—and do—to help ensure that your email, voice communications, and other cloud-based information management tools and processes are in full compliance with HIPAA’s requirements. And it describes how you can do so easily and cost-effectively.
<br> 
<br>Email: Central to Your Services—and Your Risks
<br>
<br>Now central to our lives in so many ways, email communication is integral to everything you do as a healthcare provider. It not only connects your staff with its patients (and each other), but with its many partners as well: insurers, pharmacies, specialists, service providers, and others.
<br>
<br>Think how many emails you generate every day: appointments, referrals, insurance claims, authorizations, lab results, answers to patients’ questions, and more. How many contain protected health information that requires protection under HIPAA? And how many of those sensitive emails pass beyond your own presumably secure network—to and from possibly insecure third parties, including your employees’ and partners’ mobile devices? If you do not have a secure network provider, every such email is a possible point of regulatory vulnerability or violation.
<br>
<br>Based on your status as a covered entity under HIPAA, your staff members are authorized to send and receive, among themselves, Protected Health Information (PHI) (or ePHI, when in electronic form). But your responsibility for protecting the privacy and security of such information for your patients doesn’t stop there. Just like your email, it often goes beyond the security of your network.
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Is Your Email System Compliant?
<br>
<br>Don’t assume that all business email systems are compliant with HIPAA. Many systems, including several well-known brands designed for professional or even enterprise-level use, are not.
<br>
<br>Chances are, your internal email is safe on your own secure servers and your email to and from third parties, including all email that contains PHI, is probably encrypted, as required by HIPAA. But encryption is not enough.
<br>
<br>HIPAA requires that the technical safeguards for your email system and practices fall into three main categories:
<br>
<br>Access control and authentication. A covered entity must implement policies and procedures that only allow authorized personnel to access ePHI.  For example, each of your staff members must have a unique username and password for identification and tracking purposes. Shared logins are not permitted. Furthermore, you must have procedures for verifying that anyone seeking access to ePHI is who they claim to be.
<br>
<br>ePHI security and integrity, in storage and during transmission. You have to protect ePHI from being improperly altered or destroyed. Beyond storing ePHI securely, this means you must also have technical security measures, including encryption, in place to prevent unauthorized access by anyone who might tamper with ePHI while it’s being transmitted out of your network.
<br>
<br>Audit controls. You have to have the hardware, software, and processes in place to record and monitor all logins to your health care information systems (including date, time, and IP address) and track all sent and received emails.
<br>
<br>Remember, the same requirements apply to covered entities with whom you communicate and share protected information with via email. In fact, they apply to any and all persons and organizations—including cloud IT providers—that you outsource your essential business services to. 
<br>
<br>Protecting Patient Records with Secure File Sharing and Syncing 
<br>
<br>Your handling and use of confidential patient health information includes more than just email content and attachments.
<br>
<br>Digital health records are essential to health care and administration. Multiple parties, both inside and outside of your organization, need access to your patients’ electronic health information and that imposes a complex set of requirements on your IT systems, including:
<br>
<br>Security. Again, HIPAA imposes an absolute responsibility for safeguarding patients’ health records, both at rest and in transit. This means you have to control multiple levels of access to that information for the many people who collaborate on patient care and related services—this includes your many diverse partners as well as your staff.  You also have to be able to monitor and audit any person, both inside and outside of your organization, who has access to or use of such records.   
<br>
<br>Integrity. To secure ePHI from improper change or destruction, you must control not only who has access to what information but also who can change a file and when.
<br>
<br>Mobility. Mobility has come to medicine. You may already be deploying authorized mobile devices, such as wifi-connected cart-based PCs in hospital wards or personal tablets for clinicians. Nowadays, more employees use their mobile devices to connect to network-based applications and files.  Some employees will use mobile devices issued by you while others will use their own personal mobile devices (a trend known as BYOD, or bring-your-own-device). Mobility adds another significant layer of complexity to the task of safeguarding their patients’ PHI.
<br>
<br>Beyond Email and Documents: HIPAA-Compliant Voice Services
<br>
<br>The requirements of HIPAA for voice communications are not, perhaps, as obvious as they are for email and document security. But yes, HIPAA does require you to safeguard PHI for voicemails and call recordings that are recorded as computers files.
<br>
<br>Like email, voice communications are myriad. They occur not only between your clinicians, patients and among your staff, but also between your organization and many parties outside of your organization, such as specialists, pharmacies, and the many other service providers and business partners with whom you need to share patient information.
<br>As with email and documents, HIPAA requires you to maintain the privacy of your patients’ voicemail content and voice accounts through strictly controlled access, secure transmission and storage.
<br>
<br>Command and Control:
<br>Your Responsibility—and Your Best Protection
<br>
<br>It’s not as if you wouldn’t want total security and control for the storage of your email, health records, voicemails, and other systems in any case. It’s just that, under HIPAA, it’s the law—and a very exacting law at that.
<br>
<br>Under HIPAA, you must be able to track and report all emails sent inside and outside of your network. But you also have to be able to track and verify access to ePHI at every attempt. In fact, you must have systems and procedures in place to record and analyze all activity in your systems that store or use ePHI. And you must be able to document the access and security controls you have in place to protect patient privacy in your voice communications as well.
<br>
<br>Such audit and reporting capabilities are not just your responsibility. They are also your best protection. They enable you to maintain your systems’ performance and compliance at peak levels and spot vulnerabilities before they escalate into problems. And they give you the data you need to demonstrate your compliance. That’s essential, because HIPAA requires not just that you comply with its broad set of requirements, but also that you be able to prove your compliance through regular audits and in the event of an inquiry or claim.
